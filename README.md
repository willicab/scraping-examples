A list of scripts in which I have worked

## Dolar scripts
There are some scripts to extract information about the value of the dollar from different sources

1. `bolivarcucuta.php` get the information from [http://bolivarcucuta.com](http://bolivarcucuta.com)
1. `btcve.php` get the information from [http://bitcoinvenezuela.com](http://bitcoinvenezuela.com)
1. `dolartoday.php` get the information from [https://dolartoday.com](https://dolartoday.com)
